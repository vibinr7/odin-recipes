    <h1>Creamy egg salad with a little tang.</h1>
    <p>Hands down, this was the best Egg Salad that I've ever made. I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef. Following some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks</p>
    <p> I made this meatloaf with my boyfriend. Not only was it delicious but we had a lot of fun making it. At first i was worried that it would be too onion-y, but using the whole onion was well worth it.</p>
